shell access</a> to your webserver and you're comfortable running commands on
the command line, please select your server software and the operating system
it is running from the dropdown menu above. If you don't have these privileges
on your webserver or you're not familiar with command line server
administration, Certbot probably isn't the best option to enable HTTPS on your
site. Instead, you should check if your hosting provider has built-in Let's
Encrypt support by contacting them or <a

checking this list of supporting providers</a>.
</p>
<p>
If your hosting provider doesn't provide built-in Let's Encrypt support, you
should ask them to add it! Dozens of providers, with millions of customers,
conveniently allow their users to obtain Let's Encrypt certificates
automatically. Let's Encrypt works hard to make adding this support as easy
possible and it is one of the easiest and best ways for users to increase the
security of their websites.

conveniently allow their users to obtain Let's Encrypt certificates
automatically. Let's Encrypt works hard to make adding this support as easy

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
./path/to/certbot-auto renew --dry-run 
</pre>


If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>./path/to/certbot-auto renew --quiet --no-self-upgrade</pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet  support automatic
installation you should probably use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>
./path/to/certbot-auto certonly
</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain

choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two

</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories.

<h2>Experimental Nginx Plugin Support</h2>
<blockquote>
    There is a pre-alpha Nginx plugin that will automatically obtain and
    install certs.  It is known to be buggy, so <b>you should only use it
    after backing up your config</b> and if you are comfortable fixing
    possible breakage.  On some
    platforms there's a <tt>certbot-nginx</tt> or <tt>letsencrypt-nginx</tt>
    or <tt>python-certbot-nginx</tt>
    package you can install to get that plugin.  If not, you can <a
    href="/docs/contributing.html#running-a-local-copy-of-the-client">follow
    the developer instructions</a> to run Certbot with Nginx support from git
    master.

    <p>
      <h3>Install</h3>
<p>
Since it doesn't seem like your operating system has a packaged version of Certbot, you should use our certbot-auto script to get a copy:
</p>
<pre>wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto
chmod a+x certbot-auto</pre>
<p>
<tt>certbot-auto</tt> accepts the same flags as <tt>certbot</tt>; it
 installs all of its own

<pre>
$ ./certbot-auto
</pre>
</p>

      <p>
Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet officially  support automatic
installation you should probably use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>
./path/to/certbot-auto certonly
</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
./path/to/certbot-auto renew --dry-run 
</pre>


If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>./path/to/certbot-auto renew --quiet --no-self-upgrade</pre>

  <p>
    First you'll have to follow the instructions <a href='http://backports.debian.org/Instructions/'>here</a> to enable the Jessie backports repo, if you have not already done so. Then do:

      <p>
Certbot has a fairly solid beta-quality Apache plugin, which is supported on
many platforms, and automates both obtaining and installing certs:
</p>
<pre>$ certbot --apache</pre>
<p>
If you're feeling more conservative and would like to make the changes to your
Apache configuration by hand, you can use the <tt>certonly</tt>
subcommand:
<pre>$ certbot --apache certonly</pre>

    <aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
        <p>the apache plugin with <tt>certonly</tt> does the following:<br>
        <ol>
          <li>make temporary config changes<br>
          (adding a new vhost to pass an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-acme-acme-02#section-7.3">ACME Challenge</a>, and enabling <tt>mod_ssl</tt> if necessary)</li>
          <li>performs a graceful reload</li>
          <li>reverts all changes</li>
          <li>performs another graceful reload</li>
        </ol>
        This appears to be a reliable process, but if you don't want Certbot
        to touch your Apache process or files in any way, you can use the
        <a
        href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#webroot">webroot plugin</a>.

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
The Certbot packages on your system come with a cron job that will
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>

Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet  support automatic
installation you should probably use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>
certbot certonly
</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and

<h2>Experimental Nginx Plugin Support</h2>
<blockquote>
    There is a pre-alpha Nginx plugin that will automatically obtain and
    install certs.  It is known to be buggy, so <b>you should only use it
    after backing up your config</b> and if you are comfortable fixing
    possible breakage.  On some
    platforms there's a <tt>certbot-nginx</tt> or <tt>letsencrypt-nginx</tt>
    or <tt>python-certbot-nginx</tt>
    package you can install to get that plugin.  If not, you can <a

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
The Certbot packages on your system come with a cron job that will
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
certbot renew --dry-run 
</pre>



<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a

<h2>Experimental Nginx Plugin Support</h2>
<blockquote>
    There is a pre-alpha Nginx plugin that will automatically obtain and
    install certs.  It is known to be buggy, so <b>you should only use it
    after backing up your config</b> and if you are comfortable fixing
    possible breakage.  On some
    platforms there's a <tt>certbot-nginx</tt> or <tt>letsencrypt-nginx</tt>
    or <tt>python-certbot-nginx</tt>
    package you can install to get that plugin.  If not, you can <a

    <h3>
      Advanced Install
    </h3>
    <p>
      <h3>Install</h3>
<p>
  Since Certbot is packaged for your system, all you'll need to do is apt-get the following packages.
</p>


<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install certbot 
</pre>

    </p>
    <h3>
      Advanced Get Started
    </h3>
    <p>
      <p>
Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet  support automatic
installation you&#39;ll have to use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>
certbot certonly
</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and
<tt>www.example.com</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
$ certbot certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com
</pre>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
The Certbot packages on your system come with a cron job that will
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>

    <h3>
      Advanced Get Started
    </h3>
    <p>
      <p>
Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet officially  support automatic
installation you should probably use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>
./path/to/certbot-auto certonly
</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and
<tt>www.example.com</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
$ ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com
</pre>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
./path/to/certbot-auto renew --dry-run 
</pre>


If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>./path/to/certbot-auto renew --quiet --no-self-upgrade</pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

Certificate installation with HAProxy is complicated; you probably want to follow one of these guides.

<h2>Experimental Nginx Plugin Support</h2>
<blockquote>
    There is a pre-alpha Nginx plugin that will automatically obtain and
    install certs.  It is known to be buggy, so <b>you should only use it
    after backing up your config</b> and if you are comfortable fixing
    possible breakage.  On some
    platforms there's a <tt>certbot-nginx</tt> or <tt>letsencrypt-nginx</tt>
    or <tt>python-certbot-nginx</tt>
    package you can install to get that plugin.  If not, you can <a
    href="/docs/contributing.html#running-a-local-copy-of-the-client">follow
    the developer instructions</a> to run Certbot with Nginx support from git
    master.

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
letsencrypt renew --dry-run --agree-tos
</pre>

There's a bug in the version of Certbot on Ubuntu Xenial which may show a warning
saying 'Registering without email!' even if you have previously given an email to
Certbot. Don't worry if this happens, it will not affect your renewal.

If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>letsencrypt renew </pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

<h2>Experimental Nginx Plugin Support</h2>
<blockquote>
    There is a pre-alpha Nginx plugin that will automatically obtain and
    install certs.  It is known to be buggy, so <b>you should only use it
    after backing up your config</b> and if you are comfortable fixing
    possible breakage.  On some
    platforms there's a <tt>certbot-nginx</tt> or <tt>letsencrypt-nginx</tt>
    or <tt>python-certbot-nginx</tt>
    package you can install to get that plugin.  If not, you can <a

        <p>Ubuntu Xenial has an old version of Certbot packaged for it that lacks a few features. The <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#webroot">webroot plugin</a> doesn't have an interactive mode, so you'll need to specify your domains and webroot paths on the command line to use this plugin.
        </p>
</aside>
<pre>
$ letsencrypt certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and
<tt>www.example.com</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
$ letsencrypt certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com
</pre>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
letsencrypt renew --dry-run --agree-tos
</pre>

There's a bug in the version of Certbot on Ubuntu Xenial which may show a warning
saying 'Registering without email!' even if you have previously given an email to
Certbot. Don't worry if this happens, it will not affect your renewal.

If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>letsencrypt renew </pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

    <h3>
      Advanced Get Started
    </h3>
    <p>
      <p>
Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet officially  support automatic
installation you should probably use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>
./path/to/certbot-auto certonly
</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and
<tt>www.example.com</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
$ ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com
</pre>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
./path/to/certbot-auto renew --dry-run 
</pre>


If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>./path/to/certbot-auto renew --quiet --no-self-upgrade</pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

Certificate installation with HAProxy is complicated; you probably want to follow one of these guides.

Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet  support automatic
installation you should probably use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>
./path/to/certbot-auto certonly
</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
./path/to/certbot-auto renew --dry-run 
</pre>


If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>./path/to/certbot-auto renew --quiet --no-self-upgrade</pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

<h2>Experimental Nginx Plugin Support</h2>
<blockquote>
    There is a pre-alpha Nginx plugin that will automatically obtain and
    install certs.  It is known to be buggy, so <b>you should only use it
    after backing up your config</b> and if you are comfortable fixing
    possible breakage.  On some
    platforms there's a <tt>certbot-nginx</tt> or <tt>letsencrypt-nginx</tt>
    or <tt>python-certbot-nginx</tt>
    package you can install to get that plugin.  If not, you can <a
    href="/docs/contributing.html#running-a-local-copy-of-the-client">follow
    the developer instructions</a> to run Certbot with Nginx support from git

    <p>
      <p>
Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet  support automatic
installation you&#39;ll have to use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>
./path/to/certbot-auto certonly
</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and
<tt>www.example.com</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
$ ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com
</pre>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
./path/to/certbot-auto renew --dry-run 
</pre>


If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>./path/to/certbot-auto renew --quiet --no-self-upgrade</pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
certbot renew --dry-run 
</pre>


If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>certbot renew --quiet </pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full

Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet  support automatic
installation you&#39;ll have to use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>
certbot certonly
</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
certbot renew --dry-run 
</pre>


If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>certbot renew --quiet </pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet  support automatic
installation you should probably use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>
./path/to/certbot-auto certonly
</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to

$ ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
./path/to/certbot-auto renew --dry-run 
</pre>


If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>./path/to/certbot-auto renew --quiet --no-self-upgrade</pre>

<h2>Experimental Nginx Plugin Support</h2>
<blockquote>
    There is a pre-alpha Nginx plugin that will automatically obtain and
    install certs.  It is known to be buggy, so <b>you should only use it
    after backing up your config</b> and if you are comfortable fixing
    possible breakage.  On some
    platforms there's a <tt>certbot-nginx</tt> or <tt>letsencrypt-nginx</tt>
    or <tt>python-certbot-nginx</tt>
    package you can install to get that plugin.  If not, you can <a
    href="/docs/contributing.html#running-a-local-copy-of-the-client">follow
    the developer instructions</a> to run Certbot with Nginx support from git
    master.

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
./path/to/certbot-auto renew --dry-run 
</pre>


If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>./path/to/certbot-auto renew --quiet --no-self-upgrade</pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

      Advanced Install
    </h3>
    <p>
      <h3>Install</h3>
<p>
Since it doesn't seem like your operating system has a packaged version of Certbot, you should use our certbot-auto script to get a copy:
</p>
<pre>wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto
chmod a+x certbot-auto</pre>
<p>
<tt>certbot-auto</tt> accepts the same flags as <tt>certbot</tt>; it
is a wrapper that installs all of its own
dependencies and updates the client code automatically. So you can just run:
<pre>
$ ./certbot-auto
</pre>
</p>
<p>
<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
  <p><tt>certbot-auto</tt> will always try to fetch the newest version of
  itself from its most recent release. If you want it to be locked to a
  specific version and not receive automatic updates, run it with the
  <tt>--no-self-upgrade</tt> flag. Also, if you're nervous about downloading and
  running scripts from the network, some <a

Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet  support automatic
installation you&#39;ll have to use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>
./path/to/certbot-auto certonly
</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two

      <p>
Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet officially  support automatic
installation you should probably use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>
certbot certonly
</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and
<tt>www.example.com</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
$ certbot certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com
</pre>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
certbot renew --dry-run 
</pre>


If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>certbot renew --quiet </pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

<p>
Certificate installation with HAProxy is complicated; you probably want to follow one of these guides.

    <h3>
      Advanced Get Started
    </h3>
    <p>
      <p>
Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet  support automatic
installation you should probably use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>
./path/to/certbot-auto certonly
</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and
<tt>www.example.com</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
$ ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com
</pre>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
./path/to/certbot-auto renew --dry-run 
</pre>


If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>./path/to/certbot-auto renew --quiet </pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

<h2>Experimental Nginx Plugin Support</h2>
<blockquote>
    There is a pre-alpha Nginx plugin that will automatically obtain and
    install certs.  It is known to be buggy, so <b>you should only use it
    after backing up your config</b> and if you are comfortable fixing
    possible breakage.  On some
    platforms there's a <tt>certbot-nginx</tt> or <tt>letsencrypt-nginx</tt>
    or <tt>python-certbot-nginx</tt>
    package you can install to get that plugin.  If not, you can <a
    href="/docs/contributing.html#running-a-local-copy-of-the-client">follow
    the developer instructions</a> to run Certbot with Nginx support from git
    master.

    <h3>
      Advanced Get Started
    </h3>
    <p>
      <p>
Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet officially  support automatic
installation you should probably use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>
./path/to/certbot-auto certonly
</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and
<tt>www.example.com</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
$ ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com
</pre>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
./path/to/certbot-auto renew --dry-run 
</pre>


If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>./path/to/certbot-auto renew --quiet </pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

Certificate installation with HAProxy is complicated; you probably want to follow one of these guides.

<p>
Certbot is packaged in EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux). To use
Certbot, you must first <a
href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL#How_can_I_use_these_extra_packages.3F">
enable the EPEL repository</a>.
</p>
<p>
After doing this, you can install Certbot by running:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo yum install certbot
</pre>

    </p>
    <h3>
      Advanced Get Started
    </h3>
    <p>
      <p>
Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet  support automatic
installation you should probably use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>
certbot certonly
</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and
<tt>www.example.com</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
$ certbot certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com
</pre>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
certbot renew --dry-run 
</pre>


If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>certbot renew --quiet </pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we

<h2>Experimental Nginx Plugin Support</h2>
<blockquote>
    There is a pre-alpha Nginx plugin that will automatically obtain and
    install certs.  It is known to be buggy, so <b>you should only use it
    after backing up your config</b> and if you are comfortable fixing
    possible breakage.  On some
    platforms there's a <tt>certbot-nginx</tt> or <tt>letsencrypt-nginx</tt>
    or <tt>python-certbot-nginx</tt>
    package you can install to get that plugin.  If not, you can <a
    href="/docs/contributing.html#running-a-local-copy-of-the-client">follow
    the developer instructions</a> to run Certbot with Nginx support from git
    master.

<p>
  Run these steps to install the Certbot client.
</p>

    <h3>
      Automated Get Started
    </h3>
    <p>
      <p>
Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet  support automatic
installation you&#39;ll have to use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>
certbot certonly
</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and
<tt>www.example.com</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
$ certbot certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com
</pre>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
certbot renew --dry-run 
</pre>


If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>certbot renew --quiet </pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

<h2>Experimental Nginx Plugin Support</h2>
<blockquote>
    There is a pre-alpha Nginx plugin that will automatically obtain and
    install certs.  It is known to be buggy, so <b>you should only use it
    after backing up your config</b> and if you are comfortable fixing
    possible breakage.  On some
    platforms there's a <tt>certbot-nginx</tt> or <tt>letsencrypt-nginx</tt>
    or <tt>python-certbot-nginx</tt>
    package you can install to get that plugin.  If not, you can <a

      <p>
Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet  support automatic
installation you&#39;ll have to use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>
certbot certonly
</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and
<tt>www.example.com</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
$ certbot certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com
</pre>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
certbot renew --dry-run 
</pre>


If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>certbot renew --quiet </pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">

<h2>Experimental Nginx Plugin Support</h2>

Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet officially  support automatic
installation you should probably use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>
letsencrypt certonly
</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ letsencrypt certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and
<tt>www.example.com</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
$ letsencrypt certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com
</pre>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
letsencrypt renew --dry-run 
</pre>


If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>letsencrypt renew --quiet </pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
certbot renew --dry-run 
</pre>


If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>certbot renew --quiet </pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

<h2>Experimental Nginx Plugin Support</h2>
<blockquote>
    There is a pre-alpha Nginx plugin that will automatically obtain and
    install certs.  It is known to be buggy, so <b>you should only use it
    after backing up your config</b> and if you are comfortable fixing
    possible breakage.  On some
    platforms there's a <tt>certbot-nginx</tt> or <tt>letsencrypt-nginx</tt>
    or <tt>python-certbot-nginx</tt>
    package you can install to get that plugin.  If not, you can <a

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
certbot renew --dry-run 
</pre>


If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>certbot renew --quiet </pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to

$ ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com
</pre>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
./path/to/certbot-auto renew --dry-run 
</pre>


If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>./path/to/certbot-auto renew --quiet --no-self-upgrade</pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>
