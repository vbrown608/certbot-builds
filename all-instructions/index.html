many platforms, and automates both obtaining and installing certs:
</p>
<pre>$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto --apache</pre>
<p>
Running this command will get a certificate for you and have Certbot edit your Apache configuration
automatically to serve it. If you're feeling more conservative and would like to make the changes to your
Apache configuration by hand, you can use the <tt>certonly</tt>
subcommand:

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto renew --dry-run
</pre>

If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>./path/to/certbot-auto renew --no-self-upgrade</pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

    <p>
      <p>
Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet officially  support automatic
installation you should probably use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
The Certbot packages on your system come with a cron job that will
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo certbot renew --dry-run
</pre>

If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>certbot renew </pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

      <h3>Install</h3>
<p>
  Since Certbot is packaged for your system, all you'll need to do is apt-get the following packages.
</p>

  <p>
    First you'll have to follow the instructions <a href='http://backports.debian.org/Instructions/'>here</a> to enable the Jessie backports repo, if you have not already done so. Then do:

      <p>
Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet  support automatic
installation you&#39;ll have to use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>$ sudo certbot certonly</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and
<tt>www.example.com</tt>:

<p>
  Since Certbot is packaged for your system, all you'll need to do is apt-get the following packages.
</p>


<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install python-certbot-apache

    <h3>

      <p>
Certbot has a fairly solid beta-quality Apache plugin, which is supported on
many platforms, and automates both obtaining and installing certs:
</p>
<pre>$ sudo certbot --apache</pre>
<p>
Running this command will get a certificate for you and have Certbot edit your Apache configuration
automatically to serve it. If you're feeling more conservative and would like to make the changes to your
Apache configuration by hand, you can use the <tt>certonly</tt>
subcommand:
<pre>$ sudo certbot --apache certonly</pre>


To learn more about how to use Certbot <a href="/docs">read our documentation</a>.
</p>
<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
The Certbot packages on your system come with a cron job that will
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo certbot renew --dry-run
</pre>

If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>certbot renew </pre>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
The Certbot packages on your system come with a cron job that will
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo certbot renew --dry-run
</pre>

If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>certbot renew </pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

Since it doesn't seem like your operating system has a packaged version of Certbot, you should use our certbot-auto script to get a copy:
</p>
<pre>wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto
chmod a+x certbot-auto</pre>
<p>
<tt>certbot-auto</tt> accepts the same flags as <tt>certbot</tt>; it

Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet  support automatic
installation you&#39;ll have to use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and
<tt>www.example.com</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com
</pre>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto renew --dry-run
</pre>

If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>./path/to/certbot-auto renew --no-self-upgrade</pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet officially  support automatic
installation you should probably use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>$ sudo certbot certonly</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and
<tt>www.example.com</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com
</pre>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
The Certbot packages on your system come with a cron job that will
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo certbot renew --dry-run
</pre>

If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>certbot renew </pre>

Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet officially  support automatic
installation you should probably use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>$ sudo certbot certonly</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is

The Certbot packages on your system come with a cron job that will
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo certbot renew --dry-run

If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet officially  support automatic
installation you should probably use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>$ sudo certbot certonly</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories.

      <h3>Install</h3>
<p>
On Ubuntu systems, the Certbot team maintains a <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PPA">PPA</a>. Once you add it to your list of repositories all you'll need to do is apt-get the following packages.
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python-certbot-nginx 
</pre>

    </p>
    <h3>
      Advanced Get Started
    </h3>
    <p>
      <p>
Certbot has an Nginx plugin, which is supported on
many platforms, and automates both obtaining and installing certs:
</p>
<pre>$ sudo certbot --nginx</pre>
<p>
Running this command will get a certificate for you and have Certbot edit your Nginx configuration
automatically to serve it. If you're feeling more conservative and would like to make the changes to your
Nginx configuration by hand, you can use the <tt>certonly</tt>
subcommand:
<pre>$ sudo certbot --nginx certonly</pre>

    <aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
        <p>the Nginx plugin with <tt>certonly</tt> does the following:<br>
        <ol>
          <li>make temporary config changes<br>
          (adding a new server block to pass an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-acme-acme-02#section-7.3">ACME Challenge</a>)</li>
          <li>performs a graceful reload</li>
          <li>reverts all changes</li>
          <li>performs another graceful reload</li>
        </ol>
        This appears to be a reliable process, but if you don't want Certbot
        to touch your Nginx process or files in any way, you can use the
        <a
        href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#webroot">webroot plugin</a>.

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
The Certbot packages on your system come with a cron job that will
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo certbot renew --dry-run
</pre>

If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>certbot renew </pre>

Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet officially  support automatic
installation you should probably use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>$ sudo certbot certonly</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and
<tt>www.example.com</tt>:

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto renew --dry-run
</pre>

If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>./path/to/certbot-auto renew --no-self-upgrade</pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.

Since your server architecture doesn't yet officially  support automatic

certificate.
</p>
<pre>$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly</pre>

choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is

<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories.

    <h3>
      Advanced Get Started
    </h3>
    <p>
      <p>
Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet  support automatic
installation you&#39;ll have to use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and
<tt>www.example.com</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com
</pre>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto renew --dry-run
</pre>

If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>./path/to/certbot-auto renew --no-self-upgrade</pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

<p>
The Certbot client is available in Gentoo Portage. (Run the package-management commands below with <tt>sudo</tt> if not running as root.)

    <h3>
      Automated Get Started
    </h3>
    <p>
      <p>
Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet  support automatic
installation you&#39;ll have to use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>$ sudo certbot certonly</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and
<tt>www.example.com</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com
</pre>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo certbot renew --dry-run
</pre>

If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>certbot renew </pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet officially  support automatic

</p>
<pre>$ sudo certbot certonly</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain

<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.

To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will

</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories.

    <h3>
      Advanced Get Started
    </h3>
    <p>
      <p>
Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet officially  support automatic
installation you should probably use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>$ sudo certbot certonly</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and
<tt>www.example.com</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com
</pre>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo certbot renew --dry-run
</pre>

If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>certbot renew </pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

<h2>Installing a cert in HAProxy</h2>

<p>
Certificate installation with HAProxy is complicated; you probably want to follow one of these guides.

Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet officially  support automatic
installation you should probably use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>$ sudo certbot certonly</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and
<tt>www.example.com</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com
</pre>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo certbot renew --dry-run
</pre>

If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>certbot renew </pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the

Certbot has an Nginx plugin, which is supported on
many platforms, and automates both obtaining and installing certs:
</p>
<pre>$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto --nginx</pre>
<p>
Running this command will get a certificate for you and have Certbot edit your Nginx configuration
automatically to serve it. If you're feeling more conservative and would like to make the changes to your
Nginx configuration by hand, you can use the <tt>certonly</tt>
subcommand:
<pre>$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto --nginx certonly</pre>


To learn more about how to use Certbot <a href="/docs">read our documentation</a>.
</p>
<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto renew --dry-run
</pre>

If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>./path/to/certbot-auto renew </pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet officially  support automatic
installation you should probably use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and

      <h3>Install</h3>
<p>
Not all of Certbot's dependencies are available in the standard repositories.
To use Certbot, you must first <a

enable the EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) repository</a>.
</p>
<p>
Since it doesn't seem like your operating system has a packaged version of Certbot, you should use our certbot-auto script to get a copy:
</p>
<pre>wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto

Certbot has a fairly solid beta-quality Apache plugin, which is supported on
many platforms, and automates both obtaining and installing certs:
</p>
<pre>$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto --apache</pre>
<p>
Running this command will get a certificate for you and have Certbot edit your Apache configuration
automatically to serve it. If you're feeling more conservative and would like to make the changes to your
Apache configuration by hand, you can use the <tt>certonly</tt>
subcommand:
<pre>$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto --apache certonly</pre>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto renew --dry-run
</pre>

If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>./path/to/certbot-auto renew </pre>

Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet officially  support automatic
installation you should probably use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and

For Plesk you won't even need to install Certbot. Instead, use the extension already available in Plesk — it will also give you automatic renewal of your certificates out-of-the-box as well!

      <h3>Install</h3>
<p>
Not all of Certbot's dependencies are available in the standard repositories.
To use Certbot, you must first <a
href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL#How_can_I_use_these_extra_packages.3F">
enable the EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) repository</a>.
</p>
<p>
Since it doesn't seem like your operating system has a packaged version of Certbot, you should use our certbot-auto script to get a copy:
</p>
<pre>wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto
chmod a+x certbot-auto</pre>
<p>
<tt>certbot-auto</tt> accepts the same flags as <tt>certbot</tt>; it
 installs all of its own
dependencies and updates the client code automatically.
</p>

    </p>
    <h3>
      Automated Get Started
    </h3>
    <p>
      <p>
Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet  support automatic
installation you&#39;ll have to use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and
<tt>www.example.com</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com
</pre>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto renew --dry-run
</pre>

If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>./path/to/certbot-auto renew </pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo certbot renew --dry-run
</pre>

If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>certbot renew </pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

<p>
Certbot is packaged in EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux). To use
Certbot, you must first <a

enable the EPEL repository</a> and enable EPEL optional channel.
</p>
<p>
If you are using ec2  you can enable optional channel by running:
</p>
<pre>
$ yum -y install yum-utils
$ yum-config-manager --enable rhui-REGION-rhel-server-extras rhui-REGION-rhel-server-optional
</pre>
<p>
After doing this, you can install Certbot by running:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo yum install certbot

<p>
  Run these steps to install the Certbot client.

    <h3>
      Automated Get Started
    </h3>
    <p>
      <p>
Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet  support automatic
installation you&#39;ll have to use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>$ sudo certbot certonly</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and
<tt>www.example.com</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com
</pre>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo certbot renew --dry-run
</pre>

If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>certbot renew </pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the

Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet  support automatic
installation you&#39;ll have to use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>$ sudo letsencrypt certonly</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo letsencrypt certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and
<tt>www.example.com</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo letsencrypt certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com
</pre>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo letsencrypt renew --dry-run
</pre>

If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>letsencrypt renew </pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

      <p>
Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet  support automatic
installation you&#39;ll have to use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>$ sudo letsencrypt certonly</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo letsencrypt certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and
<tt>www.example.com</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo letsencrypt certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com
</pre>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo letsencrypt renew --dry-run
</pre>

If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>letsencrypt renew </pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

</p>


    </p>
    <h3>
      Advanced Install
    </h3>
    <p>
      <h3>Install</h3>
<p>
  Run these steps to install the Certbot client.
</p>
<p>Package:</p>
<pre>
pkg_add certbot
</pre>

    </p>
    <h3>
      Advanced Get Started
    </h3>
    <p>
      <p>
Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet officially  support automatic
installation you should probably use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>$ sudo certbot certonly</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and
<tt>www.example.com</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com
</pre>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo certbot renew --dry-run
</pre>

If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>certbot renew </pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto renew --dry-run
</pre>

If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>./path/to/certbot-auto renew --no-self-upgrade</pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet officially  support automatic
installation you should probably use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories.

</p>
<pre>$ sudo certbot --apache</pre>
<p>
Running this command will get a certificate for you and have Certbot edit your Apache configuration
automatically to serve it. If you're feeling more conservative and would like to make the changes to your
Apache configuration by hand, you can use the <tt>certonly</tt>
subcommand:
<pre>$ sudo certbot --apache certonly</pre>

    <aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
        <p>the apache plugin with <tt>certonly</tt> does the following:<br>
        <ol>
          <li>make temporary config changes<br>
          (adding a new vhost to pass an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-acme-acme-02#section-7.3">ACME Challenge</a>, and enabling <tt>mod_ssl</tt> if necessary)</li>
          <li>performs a graceful reload</li>
          <li>reverts all changes</li>
          <li>performs another graceful reload</li>
        </ol>
        This appears to be a reliable process, but if you don't want Certbot
        to touch your Apache process or files in any way, you can use the
        <a

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo certbot renew --dry-run
</pre>

If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>certbot renew </pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet officially  support automatic
installation you should probably use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and

For Plesk you won't even need to install Certbot. Instead, use the extension already available in Plesk — it will also give you automatic renewal of your certificates out-of-the-box as well! Read more about the extension <a href="https://ext.plesk.com/packages/f6847e61-33a7-4104-8dc9-d26a0183a8dd-letsencrypt">here</a>.

Since it doesn't seem like your operating system has a packaged version of Certbot, you should use our certbot-auto script to get a copy:
</p>
<pre>wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto
chmod a+x certbot-auto</pre>
<p>
<tt>certbot-auto</tt> accepts the same flags as <tt>certbot</tt>; it
 installs all of its own
dependencies and updates the client code automatically.

      <p>
Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet  support automatic
installation you&#39;ll have to use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and
<tt>www.example.com</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com
</pre>

<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

<p>
Certbot can be configured to
renew your certificates automatically before they expire. Since Let's Encrypt
certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable to take advantage of this
feature. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this
command:
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo ./path/to/certbot-auto renew --dry-run
</pre>

If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
by adding a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job which runs the
following:<br>

<pre>./path/to/certbot-auto renew --no-self-upgrade</pre>

<p>More detailed information and options about renewal can be found in <a
href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">the full
documentation</a>.</p>

<aside class="note">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
hour for your renewal tasks.</p>

  specific version and not receive automatic updates, run it with the
  <tt>--no-self-upgrade</tt> flag. Also, if you're nervous about downloading and
  running scripts from the network, some <a
